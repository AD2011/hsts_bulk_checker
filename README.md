# Bulk HSTS Checker
This script is designed to check whether HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled for a list of websites. It processes a file containing URLs, checks each URL for the presence of the HSTS header, and reports the results.

## Usage:
- `hsts_bulk_checker <file containing url>`
- `python3 hsts_bulk_checker.py <file containing url>`
